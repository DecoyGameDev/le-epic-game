# this is le-epic-game YOU NEED PYTHON 3 TO RUN
In this repisotry you will find my "attempt" to make a game.
If you know nothing about Python. All you need to do is have
Python 3 installed. Then run the .py. It will run the game
inside a command prompt window. (I think it works on Mac never checked)
# BEWARE. I AM NOT GOOD AT COMMITING, YOU MIGHT NEVER SEE THIS AGAIN.
